# hydroplane
A service for launching containerized processes on cloud infrastructure.

## Concepts

Hydroplane is meant to act as a simple, unified API for starting and stopping processes (deployed as Docker containers) on multiple different _backend runtimes_ in a way that abstracts as much of the complexity from connecting to and interacting with those runtimes as possible.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow the [quickstart guide in Hydroplane's documentation](https://hydro-project.github.io/hydroplane/quickstart.html).
