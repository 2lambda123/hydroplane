Hydroplane
==========

Hydroplane is a service for launching containerized processes on cloud infrastructure.

Hydroplane is meant to act as a simple, unified API for starting and stopping processes (deployed as Docker containers) on multiple different *backend runtimes* in a way that abstracts as much of the complexity from connecting to and interacting with those runtimes as possible.
